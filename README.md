# bootstrap-boilerplate
<h1> About </h1>
<p> This project might not be useful to anyone else, but this is my sandbox for getting aquainted with bootstrap and all of it nuances. This project is set up currently to work with the bootstrap repository, so if you are looking for a place to play around with bootstrap, this is a great place to start! </p>

<h1> Why? </h1>
<p> This project will give me a space to try out new things with bootstrap so I can feel confident in using it for my projects moving forward. (I did not mean for this to sound like a reflection but it feels like I am in high school again.)

<h1> How? </h1>
<p> To use this repository on your own, use the git clone command with the repository link! </p>
